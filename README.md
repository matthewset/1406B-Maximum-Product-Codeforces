My Solution was very simple. I realized that since there was negative numbers, the maximum product had to be one of the three options: the greatest 5, the greatest 3 and smallest 2, and the greatest 1 and smallest 4. This would ensure that if the smallest numbers were negative it would either be 2 or 4 negatives to create a positive product. So I just took the max of these three options and accepted!
